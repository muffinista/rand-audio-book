This is the source code used to generate the audio book version of __A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates__.


If you want to run the code yourself, you can:

- Setup an Azure account
- specify an AZURE_SPEECH_KEY and AZURE_SPEECH_REGION in your environment
- put digits.txt and deviates.txt into data/
- run generate.sh -- this will build a docker container and use it to build the output files
- Sit back and wait for a couple of hours
